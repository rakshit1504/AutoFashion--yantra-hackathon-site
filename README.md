# ðŸ‘• AutoFashion - Yantra Hackathon Project

Welcome to **AutoFashion**, our project submission for the **Yantra Hackathon**! This website is built using **React** and **Vite**, delivering a fast and efficient development experience with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and optimized build times. The site provides a sleek, user-friendly interface with seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.


## ðŸŽ¨ 3D T-shirt Modeling with Three.js + Blender

One of the standout features of **AutoFashion** is the use of **Three.js** and **Blender** to implement **real-time 3D t-shirt modeling**. Hereâ€™s what we offer:

- **Real-Time Editing**: Users can navigate and design t-shirts or hoodies in real-time using our 3D models.
- **Mannequins & Size Models**: Choose from different mannequin and size options to see how your design fits.
- **Color Grading & Selection**: Customize t-shirt colors to match your preferences.
- **Add Your Own Images**: Upload and apply your favorite pictures directly onto the t-shirt for a unique design.
- **Hoodie Design**: In addition to t-shirts, users can also design hoodies with the same real-time 3D interface.


## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

This project is powered by **React + Vite**, offering minimal setup and blazing-fast performance. Additionally, we've implemented **CSS** and **JavaScript** for text animations, enhancing the user experience with smooth transitions and interactive elements.

### Key Plugins & Libraries:
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)** â€“ Uses **Babel** for Fast Refresh.
- **Three.js** â€“ For 3D modeling and real-time t-shirt customization.
- **Blender** â€“ Used for creating 3D assets and models of the t-shirts, mannequins, and more.

## âœ¨ My Contribution  
I was primarily responsible for implementing the **frontend**, ensuring a **smooth and visually appealing user experience**. Using **React**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I added **basic text animations** and interactive elements to make the site more engaging.   
Additionally, connected the **backend with the frontend**, handling the flow of data and ensuring seamless communication between the server and client side.
