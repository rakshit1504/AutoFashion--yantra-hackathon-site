# 👕 AutoFashion - Yantra Hackathon Project   
Welcome to **AutoFashion**, our project submission for the **Yantra Hackathon**! This website is built using **React** and **Vite**, delivering a fast and efficient development experience with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and optimized build times. The site provides a sleek, user-friendly interface with seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.


## 🎨 3D T-shirt Modeling with Three.js + Blender

One of the standout features of **AutoFashion** is the use of **Three.js** and **Blender** to implement **real-time 3D t-shirt modeling**. Here’s what we offer:

- **Real-Time Editing**: Users can navigate and design t-shirts or hoodies in real-time using our 3D models.
- **Mannequins & Size Models**: Choose from different mannequin and size options to see how your design fits.
- **Color Grading & Selection**: Customize t-shirt colors to match your preferences.
- **Add Your Own Images**: Upload and apply your favorite pictures directly onto the t-shirt for a unique design.
- **Hoodie Design**: In addition to t-shirts, users can also design hoodies with the same real-time 3D interface.


## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project is powered by **React + Vite**, offering minimal setup and blazing-fast performance. Additionally, we've implemented **CSS** and **JavaScript** for text animations, enhancing the user experience with smooth transitions and interactive elements.

## 🧢 Features

## ✨ My Contribution  
I was primarily responsible for implementing the **frontend**, ensuring a **smooth and visually appealing user experience**. Using **React**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I added **basic text animations** and interactive elements to make the site more engaging.
 
Additionally, connected the **backend with the frontend**, handling the flow of data and ensuring seamless communication between the server and client side.
