## âœ¨ My Contribution  

I was primarily responsible for implementing the **frontend** of the site, ensuring a **smooth and visually appealing user experience**. Using **React**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, I added **basic text animations** and interactive elements to make the site more engaging.

Additionally, I connected the **backend with the frontend**, handling the flow of data and ensuring seamless communication between the server and client side. This combination of frontend and backend integration helped create a cohesive and functional platform for users.
